script for Badge Checking in Story Odyssey campaign

how to start:
open VSC or Codespace and type commands:

git clone https://github.com/nastrdmt/Story

npm i

Add your wallet address (you can include multiple wallets, but of course, you only have ONE) in the wallets.txt file, and it will display all possible (and impossible) Badges for now.
